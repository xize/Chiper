# Cipher
A handy program to cipher texts with a simple phrase.

### how does it work?
The program is very easy to use, the encryption is based on rijndael 256 bit encryption.  
My purpose to create such program was because I didn't found a easy program which helped me to cipher normal texts.  

This program is very suitable for encrypting OTP secrets and recovery codes by just using a phrase, this makes it alot harder for
an attacker when he holds a copy of your database.

### Keepass
in order to install this to your keepass you need to copy all the exe and dll files to your keepass installation directory.
inside that directory you will find a folder 'plugins', just past them there and restart keepass.

once you started keepass go to tools and find the text "Cipher" on older versions it is called "QR code".
